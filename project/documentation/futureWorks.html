            The sole purpose of this project was to learn the technologies. While doing this project, I tried to use
            all the technologies taught during the course. The scope of this project as of now is to fetch route information
            and weather information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under route info page, more attributes can be added like, nearest Car pooling facitily, hotel lookup, Booking system etc.
            Currently, this page provide you the available routes, step by step navigation points and the price for each route. 
            We can actually add features like Booking System that will actually book tickets for you. 
            Also, pages like profile can be modified to have industry level experience. Infact, the overall website can be enhanced to industry standards.
