<h3>
    WEEK 6 : Node JS and Open Shift
</h3>
<p>
    This week needed more focus than other previous weeks. During this week, I get to know about Express Server,
    Node JS and Open Shift Server. I tried developing some websites.

    Since Node JS is very new topic to me and many of us, I have provided a brief explanation on NodeJs in my
    <a href="../experiments/week6/Exp1/IntroToNodeJs.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 1. </a>

    I developed simple Hello World Experiment using NodeJs and Open Shift server in
    <a href="../experiments/week6/Exp2/helloFromServer.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 2. </a> During implementing
    second experiment I have to learn about git which is a very popular tool for version controlling.

    In my third experiment, I developed a simple website which takes an input from the user and prints the same
    on the Open shift server. Here is the link to
    <a href="../experiments/week6/Exp3/typeAndSee.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 3. </a> After all these, I tried 
    experimenting with JSON elements. I sucessfully rendered JSON on server side in 
    <a href="../experiments/week6/Exp4/jsonFromServer.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 4. </a> Also, I have created
    a form where you can add, edit or delete a row. I have shown it using a Team creation webpage. You can find the
    link of 
    <a href="../experiments/week6/Exp5/formServer.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 5 here. </a>

    It was a very fun experience doing all the above experiments.
