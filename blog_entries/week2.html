<h3>
    WEEK 2 : Responsive Webpage, BootStrap CSS and Basic JavaScript
</h3>
<p>
    In the last few days, we have been taught about Responsive webpages and BootStrap CSS. After learning the basics, I tried
    to develop some websites </a>. It was a very fun experience. 
</p>

<p> First, I developed a simple Responsive <a href="../experiments/week2/html/Exp4.html">webpage</a>. I used both the technology
    in this webpage i.e. Bootstrap and Responsive webpage. Another example of responsive webpage is 
    <a href="../experiments/week2/html/Exp5.html">here.</a>
    I felt really good after learing these new skills.
</p>

<p>
    Then i tried handson on JavaScirpt. I have developed three websites using javascript. 
    <a href="../experiments/week2/html/Exp1.html">First website </a>deals with simple javascript
    commands like alert etc. <a href="../experiments/week2/html/Exp2.html">Second webpage </a>deals with Google Map and Google Weather
    information. <a href="../experiments/week2/html/Exp3.html">Third Page</a> deals with Form validation. This technology is 
    really intresting as it allows us to manipulate things as per our needs.
</p>

<p>
    At last, It was a very nice experience. I am eagerly looking forward to develop some cool websites.
