<h3>WEEK 12 : Project Work </h3>
<p>Since we do not have to submit any experiments this week, I was focused more on actual project.
I tried to develop the homepage and basic login /registry modules. I have also added some features like
checking temprature of any city around the world under weather info tab. You can also look for route
information between two cities under route info tab. The project is not final yet and I have uploaded
a demo version on the OpenShift server which can be accessed by clicking <a href="http://travelguide-abhis88.rhcloud.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
