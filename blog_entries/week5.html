<h3>
    WEEK 5 : Angular JS and Routing Experiments
</h3>
<p>
    In this week, we get to know advanced features of Angular JS like Advanced Angular JS and Routing concepts.
    After that, I tried to develop some websites.
</p>

<p>
    This is the <a href="../experiments/week5/Exp2/Exp2.html" target="_blank"> first website </a> that I developed this week.
    In this experiment I have used static data stored in Array which acts as a source for the controller. In the 
    <a href="../experiments/week5/Exp3/Exp3.html" target="_blank"> second experiment </a> I have used dynamic data
    using <a href="http://www.myapifilms.com/" target="_blank"> myapifilms </a> api whichs connects to IMDB database and returns 
    the results in JSONP format. In the <a href="../experiments/week5/Exp5/Exp5.html" target="_blank">
    third experiment </a> I tried to develop a simple Blog Application. A user can write his blog limited to 100 characters
    and save it on the page although the saved content will not be persisted in database.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="../experiments/week5/Exp1/Exp1.html" target="_blank"> Fourth experiment </a> I have used Angular JS Routing.
    Routing allows webpage to avoid unnecessary page loads and can dynamically show the results on webpage.
    In <a href="../experiments/week5/Exp4/Exp4.html" target="_blank"> fifth experiment</a> I developed another routing
    experiment which dyanmically loads pages based on the login credentials. If logged using student credentials, It will show
    the pages and contents related to students. Similar behaviour can be observed for Facutly and admin credentials.

    This week was full of learning and I really enjoyed it.
