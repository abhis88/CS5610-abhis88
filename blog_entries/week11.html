<h3>WEEK 11 : Project Related Experiments </h3>
<p>I have implemented more experiments which may be helpful in my project.
<p>
    First Experiment is a Sign In page. This page is used for login purpose.
    My project homepage consist of a SignIn button. When user wants to login into the system then they will have to click on this button.
    Link to experiment is <a href="../experiments/week11/Exp1/homepage.html" target="_blank"> here. (SignIn)</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Similarly, in my second experimen, I have implemented a Sign Up module. If a new user visits my website and do not have a login credentials
    then the user can easily create his profile using this <a href="../experiments/week11/Exp2/homepage.html" target="_blank">
    Sign Up module. </a>. 
</p>


<p>
    Earlier, I have developed Project homepage. As part of experiment 3, I have developed my Project contact page. You
    can find the experiment <a href="../experiments/week11/Exp3/contact.html" target="_blank"> here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In my fourth experiment, I have used a route information API to fetch the airport details using Angular JS. I will be using this
    in my project. Link to experiment is <a href="../experiments/week11/Exp4/Exp4.html" target="_blank"> here</a>.
</p>

    Stay tuned for more updates !
