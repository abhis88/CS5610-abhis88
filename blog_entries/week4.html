<h3>
    WEEK 4 : JQuery, JSON, JSONP, Angular JS, Web API Experiments
</h3>
<p>
    This week I have learnt AJAX and Angular JS. 
    After learning the basics, I tried to develop some websites. It was a very fun experience.
</p>

<p>
    I have developed a basic <a href="../experiments/week4/html/Exp1.html" target="_blank"> AJAX webpage</a>. 
    Secondly, I developed another experiment where I designed <a href="../experiments/week4/html/Exp2.html" target="_blank"> Angular JS MVC Experiment</a>. 
    There are various options available in Angular JS. Third, I developed another experiment where I designed 
    <a href="../experiments/week4/html/Exp3.html" target="_blank"> Calculator</a>.
    Then I started working more on MVC architecture provided by Angular JS. I tried working on a webpage where you can 
    randomly add, edit and delete a row. You can see the website <a href="../experiments/week4/html/Exp4.html" target="_blank">
    here</a>.

    I also tried to developed a website where I used filter using   
    <a href="../experiments/week4/html/Exp5.html" target="_blank">Angular JS.  </a>
    I am gaining confidence on a daily basis while working on websites and using different technologies.
