<h3>WEEK 9 : Project Related Experiments </h3>
<p>Since my project is on flight related information around the United States, I have developed some experiments based on it.
<p>
    I will be having lots of pictures on my website thus I thought to implement
    <a href="../experiments/week9/Exp1/carousel.html" target="_blank">carousel</a>. Carousel will make website look good.
</p>

<p>
    Apart from pictures there will be lots of dropdowns to select the cities and dates. Thus I have implemented
    <a href="../experiments/week9/Exp2/bootstrap_dropdowns.html" target="_blank">dropdowns</a>. I tried to implement almost all
    types of dropdowns available.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, Since it is a Travel related project thus I have implemented 
    <a href="../experiments/week9/Exp3/googleMap.html" target="_blank">Google Map</a> to help other to find
    location etc.
</p>

<p>
    In this project user will be required to fill lots of information like soure and destination information, profile information,
    thus I have developed a 
    <a href="../experiments/week9/Exp4/Autocomplete.html" target="_blank">Autocomplete</a> 
    to help user to fill there data easily.
</p>

<p>
    Also, I have implemented some 
    <a href="../experiments/week9/Exp5/check.html" target="_blank">checks</a>
     on Autocomplete. For example, source and destination cannot be same.
</p>

<p>I am trying to implement the individual modules of project as part of the experiment. In future, I will be implementing
    experiments related to MEAN Stack. Stay tuned !!</p>
