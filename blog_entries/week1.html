<h3>
    WEEK 1 : HTML Basics and Cascading Style Sheet
</h3>
<p>
    During first week of "Web Development" Course, I mainly learned two technologies i.e. HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
    After learining the basics, I started developing small websites. It was a very soothing experience.

<p>
    First, I developed a simple <a href="../experiments/week1/html/Exp2.html">html form</a> with all the basic tags like input and div. 
    At this time we have not been introduced to CSS. 
    The form looks very basic. 
    After learning CSS, I started provding different styles, colors, links to my websites. I was able to use
    different CSS property like <a href="../experiments/week1/html/Exp3.html">
    padding, margin, text-color, border </a> etc. Later, I learned properties like <a href="../experiments/week1/html/Exp4.html">
    transform,
    transition and opacity</a> which can be used to provide beautiful effects. I developed some websites using these properties as part
    of week 1 coding. Also, I have developed a website using video and audio property of HTML 5.

<p>
    Overall, It was a very soothing and happy experience. I am looking forward to learn more and would like to develop
    beautiful websites.
