<h3>
    WEEK 3 : JQuery Experiments
</h3>
<p>
    After learning HTML and CSS, In the last week, we have been taught JQUERY and JQUERY UI. 
    After learning the basics, I tried to develop some websites. It was a very fun experience.
</p>

<p>
    First, I developed a basic jquery <a href="../experiments/week3/html/Exp1.html" target="_blank"> draggable webpage</a>. 
    Secondly, I developed another experiment where I designed <a href="../experiments/week3/html/Exp2.html" target="_blank"> Resizable webpage</a>. 
    There are various options available in JQUERY. Third, I developed anothr experiment where I designed 
    <a href="../experiments/week3/html/Exp3.html" target="_blank"> Selectable and Sortable webpage</a>.
    Then I worked on some other basic experiments offered by JQUERY on <a href="../experiments/week3/html/Exp2.html" target="_blank">
    this page
</a>.
    I also developed website showing the usage of <a href="../experiments/week3/html/Exp5.html" target="_blank"> JQUERY Slider </a>
    I felt really good after learing these new skills.
</p>
<p>
    At last, It was a very nice experience. I am eagerly looking forward to develop some cool websites.
