<h3>WEEK 10 : Project Related Experiments </h3>
<p>This week I have tried to develop some experiments which will be useful for my project. The experiments ranges from
    simple css to carousel to API and Json objects.
<p>
    In my first experiment, I have used CSS to develop my Project Homepage header and logo. You can see the demo 
    by clicking <a href="../experiments/week10/Exp1/P_HomePage_Title.html" target="_blank"> here (Project Homepage Header)</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Second Experiment is the extension of the first one. I have added carousel which I have developed last week to my Project
    Homepage. You can see the demo by clicking <a href="../experiments/week10/Exp2/p_homepage_carousel.html" target="_blank">
     here (Project Homepage Header and Carousel)</a>. 
    Moreover, I need to put more information on my Homepage so I decided to further extend the webpage and have added a 
    beautiful icons in lower part of the homepage. This is my third experiment and you can see the demo by clicking
    <a href="../experiments/week10/Exp3/p_homepage_demo.html" target="_blank"> here (Project Homepage Header, Carousel and more content and UI)</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Since this project depends on the input values taken from website user in the form of dropdowns or autocomplete, I
    decided to further extend my week9 autocomplete experiments to have full autocomplete using json and not without arrays.
    You can see the demo by clicking
    <a href="../experiments/week10/Exp5/p_autocomplete_city.html" target="_blank"> here (Autocomplete using JSON)</a> 
</p>

<p>
    In addition, I will be using an API to fetch data from the source as an JSON object. So, I tried to check whether 
    the source is returning proper JSON object or not. You can see the demo by clicking
    <a href="../experiments/week10/Exp6/p_json_object.html" target="_blank"> here (API JSON Object)</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In coming week, I will be implementing Login / SignUp modules. Also, I will fetch data from API and will try to play with it.
    Stay tuned !
