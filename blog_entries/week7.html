<h3>
    WEEK 7 : MongoDB, Mongoose JS and Open Shift
</h3>
<p>
    I get to know three tools this week and they are MongoDB, Mongoose JS and Open Shift.
    As we know, MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database. 
    Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational 
    database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), 
    making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster. Also,
    Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to modeling your application data and includes
     built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
    After learning these technologies, I tried developing some websites.

    Since MongoDB is a new topic to me, As my first experiment I have explained some concepts about MongoDB and Mongoose.
    <a href="../experiments/week7/Exp1/Introduction.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 1. </a>

    I developed an Experiment to show INSERT operation using MongoDB, MongooseJs and Open Shift server in
    <a href="../experiments/week7/Exp2/MongoDB_Insert.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 2. </a> 

    In my third experiment, I have shown how to find / Select data from MongoDB. Here is the link to
    <a href="../experiments/week7/Exp3/MongoDB_Find.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 3. </a> 
    
    In my fourth experiment, I have shown how to take count of data present in MongoDB. Link to experiment is here 
    <a href="../experiments/week7/Exp4/MongoDB_Count.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 4. </a> 

    In my fifth experiment, I have show how to delete / remove data from MongoDB. Here is the link to
    <a href="../experiments/week7/Exp5/MongoDB_Delete.html" target="_blank"> Experiment 5 here. </a>

    It was challenging experience. I am looking forward to develop Project oriented experiments in coming week.
